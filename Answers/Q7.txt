Code documentation is the process of providing detailed and structured instructions or guidelines for someone to follow, either as a guide or manual, to understand how something works. It can be written in words, using plain language, or using visual elements such as diagrams, charts, graphs, tables, etc.

Here's how you might structure your code documentation:

- **Writing the Documentation**
  - Use clear and concise sentences: Do not use overly technical terms unless they are specific to the technology being used. For example, instead of saying "Introduce a new data structure," say "We introduce a new key-value pair object class."
  
- **Structured Guide**
  - Use headings and subheadings to make your documentation easier to navigate. Include sections such as "Getting Started" or "Using the Tool" to guide beginners to familiarize themselves with something.

- **Documentation Guidelines**
  - For large projects, consider using a checklist for tasks like reviewing requirements, implementing changes, testing code, etc., and setting deadlines. This helps keep everyone on the same page.

- **Feedback and Suggestions**
  - Provide feedback from users who have interacted with your documentation or any questions they may have about the topic.

- **Examples and Examples of Code**
  - Use examples to illustrate concepts. For example, if you're documenting a specific algorithm in C++, include code snippets that explain how it works, where it comes from, and what it does.

- **Version Information**
  - Provide version control information such as GitHub or GitLab for easier tracking changes over time.

- **Testing**
  - Include tests to verify functionality of your documentation.

- **Accessibility Guidelines**
  - Ensure the documentation is accessible to all users, not just those who can read and understand English. Tools like Markdown, HTML, etc., can make this easier.

- **Legal Considerations**
  - Keep in mind copyright laws and any other legal requirements when writing or updating code documentation.

Remember, your purpose is to help others learn how to use the technology you're documenting. So, write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand instructions that provide value and practical application for users.
