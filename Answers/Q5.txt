Oh, dear Earth Mother,
With her gentle gaze,
She watches over us all.
Her trees stand tall and proud,
She protects us like this.

From the windswept peaks,
To the gentle streams that flow,
She is always at our side,
Always ready to protect.

The sun rises high above,
And sets down with a sigh
The stars twinkle in the night sky,
A sight so rare.

With her songs and chants she sings,
She tells us stories of time's past.
With her winds that blow like a breeze,
She cleanses the air, a gift.

So let us care for this land,
To keep it pure from harm.
Let us love nature and our own,
And cherish this precious planet.
