In the United States, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her resignation effective immediately after she signed the state's COVID-19 vaccine mandate order. Governor Whitmer's decision was made to allow individuals in Michigan who are 65 years of age or older, pregnant women, and those working under certain conditions (such as healthcare workers) to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This move was intended to provide healthcare workers with more safety during an emergency situation like this. The new order also allows people vaccinated for COVID-19 to travel between states without being tested again after return home from a trip, which means less strain on facilities and hospitals. However, some residents and healthcare providers have criticized the new vaccine mandate order due to concerns about potential side effects or unintended consequences of vaccines such as allergic reactions. Some argue that the state's emergency powers are not sufficient to address the severity of COVID-19. The Governor's decision is a significant step in the fight against the pandemic, but it's also up for further review and consideration by health experts.
