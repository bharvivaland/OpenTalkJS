Dear [Recipient],
I find myself unable to meet the deadlines set out for me by your company, and I regret to inform you that this is the reason why I am writing to you.
During the last quarter of last year, your company hired me as a team member, and due to my personal reasons, I was unable to fulfill my responsibilities. As such, I have made several promises to you and I will not be meeting these obligations any more.
As you may know, I have been working for your company for two years now, and I am grateful for the opportunity that has been provided to me. However, due to personal reasons, I cannot continue in this role with your company anymore.
I am writing to inform you of my decision to leave your company, but it is important to note that I will be working from home until such time as I can find a suitable position or the situation does not allow for the return of my services at the company's premises. I understand that this may cause inconvenience to any team members and their families.
I hope you accept my resignation with sincerity, and I am looking forward to starting new opportunities in my career once it is back on track. If there are any issues or concerns regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to let me know.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
